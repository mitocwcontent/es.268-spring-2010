Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Objectives
----------

Students will learn to apply mathematical strategies to both play and implement their own games. This year the course will try to focus on some open problems in the field of combinatorial game theory. Most of all, we will have fun while playing games and learning math concepts at the same time!

Materials
---------

There is no textbook for this class, but students are expected to read weekly course notes. Occasional outside readings will be assigned.

Recommended Readings
--------------------

Readings are not necessary to understand the topics in class, but offer a chance to further explore the games we encounter.
